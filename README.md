# 📱 Telco Customer Churn Classification (Decision Tree C4.5)

This project built to classify *customer churn* in a telecommunications company.

The classification model used is the **Decision Tree C4.5**, implemented using Scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy')`. This application demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to K-Fold validation, evaluation, and model interpretation.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- To build a **Decision Tree C4.5** classification model to predict `Churn`.
- To apply **Data Preprocessing** to handle inconsistent data and missing values.
- To implement robust model validation using **K-Fold Cross-Validation**.
- To evaluate model performance using **Accuracy, Precision, and Recall** metrics.
- To extract and display **IF-THEN Rules** from the decision tree for interpretation.

## 🧩 Process Flow & Model

The application executes several key steps when the "Proses" (Process) button is clicked:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Corrects data types for `SeniorCitizen` (to string) and `TotalCharges` (to float).
    - Handles blank space values (' ') in `TotalCharges` by converting them to `NaN`.
    - **Handles Missing Values** using **Mean Substitution**:
        - `TotalCharges`: `NaN` values are filled with the column's mean.
        - `tenure`: `0` values (treated as invalid) are converted to `NaN` and then filled with the column's mean.

2.  **Label Encoding:**
    - All categorical features (data type `object`) are automatically converted into numerical values using `LabelEncoder` to be processed by the model.

3.  **K-Fold Validation:**
    - The data is split into *k-folds* (where *k* is defined by user input).
    - The model is trained and evaluated *k* times to ensure its performance is robust.

4.  **Model (Decision Tree C4.5):**
    - **Algorithm:** `DecisionTreeClassifier`
    - **Criterion:** `criterion='entropy'` (to implement the C4.5 algorithm)

## 📈 Results & Evaluation

For each *fold* in the validation process, the application displays:

- **Confusion Matrix:** Including a breakdown of **True Positive (TP)**, **False Negative (FN)**, **False Positive (FP)**, and **True Negative (TN)**.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - `Accuracy`
  - `Precision`
  - `Recall`
- **Rule Extraction:** Displays the (IF-THEN) decision logic generated by the model for that specific fold.

Finally, the application shows the **highest accuracy score** achieved across all completed folds.
